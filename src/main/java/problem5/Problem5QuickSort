Problem 5 (3pt):
(a) (1.5pt) Consider the array which has been partitioned by the first step of quicksort:
1, 2, 4, 3, 6, 8, 7
Which of these elements could have been the pivot? (list ALL possible options).
Your answer + explanation:
2 : 1 is less than 2, all elements is greater than 2
6 : all the elements left 6 is less than 6 and 8 and 7 are greater than 6


(b) (1.5 pt)  Suppose we always pick the last element as the pivot as we run quick sort.
Give an example of a list that gives the worst case performance for quick sort.
Your answer + explanation:
[2,3,4,5,6,1]
